## Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Matt Kibbler.

I have around 14 years of experience in web and software development, for roughly the last six years I've been a core member of Solder Creativeâ€™s development team, delivering a wide range of digital products including websites, apps, and interactive installations. Some examples of these are:

- A tablet app to assist boaters complete with custom navigation system
- Interactive installations built with Electron including a photo booth and touch-activated projections
- A selection of data-driven applications built using Laravel with custom dashboard and APIs
- A variety of static websites built with Astro
- Cross-platform apps using Ionic/Capacitor and React Native
- Content managed websites using CMS systems like CraftCMS

My primary tech stack includes Laravel, PHP, and Vue.js with TypeScript along with anything else I can utilise to get the job done. These days I'm enjoying writing projects in Go and hope to do more.
